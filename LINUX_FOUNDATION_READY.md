## Potential Review Questions & Answers

### Q: What makes Vagus unique in AI safety?
**A**: Vagus introduces a blockchain-based "vagal nerve layer" inspired by the human autonomic nervous system, providing real-time safety controls for autonomous agents through dynamic parameter scaling and automated capability revocation.

### Q: How does cross-chain safety work?
**A**: Vagus maintains safety state across multiple blockchains (EVM and CosmWasm) through coordinated oracles and relayers, ensuring consistent safety policies regardless of execution environment.

### Q: What is the current development status?
**A**: Core functionality is implemented and tested (v0.1.0-alpha). The project has completed all planned milestones (M1-M20) and is ready for community expansion and production hardening.

### Q: How does the community governance work?
**A**: The project follows standard open-source governance with clear contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and maintainer responsibilities. Future governance will be enhanced through Linux Foundation support.
