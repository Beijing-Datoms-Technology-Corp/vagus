## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Vagus team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@vagus.io](mailto:security@vagus.io)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: For highly sensitive issues, contact the maintainers directly

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, a minimal proof of concept

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Considerations

### Vagus-Specific Security Areas

Given Vagus's role as a safety layer for autonomous agents, special attention should be paid to:

1. **ANS State Manipulation**: Attempts to manipulate the Autonomic Nervous System state
2. **Capability Token Exploitation**: Unauthorized minting, transfer, or use of capability tokens
3. **Vagal Brake Bypass**: Attempts to bypass safety scaling mechanisms
4. **Reflex Arc Tampering**: Manipulation of automated revocation systems
5. **Cross-Chain Consistency**: Issues affecting cross-chain state synchronization
6. **Telemetry Integrity**: Tampering with device sensor data or evidence processing
7. **Oracle Manipulation**: Attacks on the Tone Oracle or VTI computation
8. **Schema Validation**: Bypassing policy validation or schema enforcement

### General Security Areas

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, access control
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak randomness, signature verification, hash collisions
- **Network Security**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, message integrity
- **Infrastructure Security**: Server vulnerabilities, configuration issues, data exposure

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
2. **Security Testing**: Include security-focused tests in your contributions
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Access Control**: Follow the principle of least privilege
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially in smart contracts
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without information leakage

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check logs for suspicious activity
4. **Network Security**: Use secure communication channels
5. **Key Management**: Securely store and manage private keys
6. **Regular Audits**: Consider regular security audits for production deployments

## Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis tools for common security issues
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Automated tools for smart contract security
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images

### Manual Security Review

- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review process
- **Architecture Review**: Regular review of security architecture
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic penetration testing of the system
- **Third-Party Audits**: External security audits for critical components

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is available. Updates will be:

1. **Immediate**: For critical vulnerabilities
2. **Scheduled**: For high-severity vulnerabilities
3. **Regular**: For medium and low-severity vulnerabilities

## Disclosure Timeline

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **0-48 hours**: Acknowledge receipt of vulnerability report
2. **1-5 days**: Initial assessment and triage
3. **5-30 days**: Investigation and fix development
4. **30-90 days**: Testing and validation
5. **90+ days**: Public disclosure (if not already disclosed)

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published in:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For technical details
- **Project Documentation**: For user-facing information
- **Community Channels**: For broader awareness
